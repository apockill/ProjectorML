Great! Now click on the open window. It should display a live view of the camera

Move your mouse around the window. Notice how the projector is moving around an X?
Your goal is to move that X onto four corners of a flat plane. Say, a table or wall. 

Move that X onto the corner of a table, then left click. Now move your mouse- see 
the line that's following it? Move it to the next corner. Then the next.

Once 4 corners have been selected, you will move to the next step.

Fantastic! You have made 4 points on the projectors point of view. Now it's time to

What does that mean? Simply click on the projected X that should be on your screen

This will happen four times, then you will be done creating the surface!
